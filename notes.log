Excluding log files

Measurement and appraisal of log files is not useful and generate kernel spam every time one is opened. It would be useful to exclude known log files, and with the help of SELinux, it is possible to so. List the log file types SELinux knows about:
user $seinfo -alogfile -x

With this in hand, known log files can be excluded from appraisal and measurement by including this snippet before any "appraise" or "measure" rules
