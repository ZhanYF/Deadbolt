To label the filesystem use the following kernel command line:
lsm=integrity ima_hash=sha256 ima_policy=tcb ima_appraise=fix

To log the results without enforcing them use the following:
lsm=integrity ima_hash=sha256 ima_policy=tcb ima_appraise=log

To run in enforcing mode (deny access to files failing checks) use the
following kernel command line (not tested):

lsm=integrity ima_hash=sha256 ima_policy=tcb ima_appraise=enforce

At one time lacking "lsm=integrity" would cause kernel panics

                        The builtin policies to load during IMA setup.
                        Format: "tcb | appraise_tcb | secure_boot |
                                 fail_securely | critical_data"

                        The "tcb" policy measures all programs exec'd, files
                        mmap'd for exec, and all files opened with the read
                        mode bit set by either the effective uid (euid=0) or
                        uid=0.

                        The "appraise_tcb" policy appraises the integrity of
                        all files owned by root.


Make sure all filesystems are mounted with the "iversion" option (seen as "i_version" in /proc/mounts)
