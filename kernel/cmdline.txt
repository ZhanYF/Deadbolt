To label the filesystem use the following kernel command line:
lsm=integrity ima_policy=appraise_tcb ima_appraise=fix

To run in enforcing mode (deny access to files failing checks) use the
following kernel command line (not tested):

lsm=integrity ima_policy=appraise_tcb ima_appraise=enforce

At one time lacking "lsm=integrity" would cause kernel panics
