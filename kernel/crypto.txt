The file certs/signing_key.pem from the Linux kernel build tree is compiled
into the kernel and should be used to sign certificates so the kernel can
recognise them.


The serial number for a given x509 cert can be found with the following:

openssl x509 -noout -serial -in /etc/keys/<filename>.der -inform DER

or to access it through the public keys .pem file:

openssl x509 -noout -serial -in /etc/keys/<filename>.pem -inform PEM

make sure to replace <filename>
